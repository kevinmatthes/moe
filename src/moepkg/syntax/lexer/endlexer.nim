## In case of line comments, the whole rest of the line belongs to the comment.
## Thus, until the end of line is reached, every character belongs to the
## line comment token.

## Skip line whitespace characters, these are spaces and tabs.
##
## In most languages, the line whitespaces characters are unimportant for lexing
## the source code.  Thus, these characters can be savely skipped.
